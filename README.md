Copy the directory and go to root folder and write to the terminal

`npm run dev`


- see that you have node 12 in use

- for modifying angular-src you have to have an older angular version in use write in to the terminal
    `npm uninstall -g @angular/cli` 
    which enables to load the older version and then write
    `npm install -g angular-cli`
    - go to the angular directory and install dependencies with `npm install` in the terminal
    - write ´ng serve´ in angular-src directory and `npm run start` that the mongodb server starts
    - in the end write `ng build` in the angular-src file to build the public folder
